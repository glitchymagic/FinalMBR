# Incident and FCR Drill-Down Implementation Status

## Backend Implementation âœ… COMPLETE

### Incident Drill-Down Endpoint
- **Endpoint**: `/api/incident_drilldown` 
- **Status**: Working
- **Key Features**:
  - Most affected applications categorized from descriptions
  - Top incident categories by assignment group
  - Major vs routine incident breakdown
  - Regional distribution
  - Daily patterns and peak hours analysis
  - Sample critical incidents

### FCR Drill-Down Endpoint  
- **Endpoint**: `/api/fcr_drilldown`
- **Status**: Working
- **Key Features**:
  - FCR rate analysis by month
  - Top reasons for reopens
  - Best/worst performing teams
  - Incident types with highest FCR success
  - KB usage correlation with FCR
  - Sample reopened incidents

## Frontend Implementation ðŸš§ PARTIAL

### Completed:
1. **Chart Click Handlers**: Added to Incident and FCR charts
2. **Open/Close Functions**: Created for both modals
3. **Fetch Functions**: Created to retrieve data from endpoints

### Still Needed:
1. **Modal HTML Structures**: Need to create the actual modal HTML for:
   - Incident drill-down modal (id="incident-drilldown-modal")
   - FCR drill-down modal (id="fcr-drilldown-modal")

2. **Populate Functions**: Need to create:
   - `populateIncidentDrillDown(data)` function
   - `populateFCRDrillDown(data)` function

3. **Event Listeners**: Need to add:
   - Close modal on outside click
   - Close modal on ESC key
   - MTTR modal already has these, need to add for new modals

## Note
The existing "incident-modal" (id="incident-modal") is for individual incident details, not the monthly drill-down analysis we're implementing.

## Next Steps
1. Create the modal HTML structures similar to MTTR drill-down modal
2. Implement the populate functions to display the data
3. Add event listeners for modal closing
4. Test the complete flow from chart click to modal display
