# Sticky Header Fix Applied - Team Performance Table

## 🎯 **Issue Fixed**
The Team Performance table header row was not remaining solid/sticky when scrolling up and down, making it difficult to see column names when viewing data further down in the table.

## ✅ **Solution Applied**
Enhanced the sticky header implementation in `templates/dashboard.html` around lines 910-920.

### **Technical Changes Made:**

1. **Enhanced Z-Index**: Added `z-10` class to ensure header stays above table content
2. **Reinforced Background**: Added `bg-gray-800` to both `<tr>` and each `<th>` element for solid coverage
3. **Added Shadow**: Added `shadow-md` class for better visual distinction
4. **Increased Padding**: Changed from `py-2` to `py-3` for improved readability

### **Before Fix:**
```html
<thead class="sticky top-0 bg-gray-800">
    <tr class="text-gray-400 border-b border-gray-700">
        <th class="text-left py-2 px-2">Rank</th>
        <!-- ... other headers ... -->
    </tr>
</thead>
```

### **After Fix:**
```html
<thead class="sticky top-0 bg-gray-800 z-10 shadow-md">
    <tr class="text-gray-400 border-b border-gray-700 bg-gray-800">
        <th class="text-left py-3 px-2 bg-gray-800">Rank</th>
        <!-- ... other headers with bg-gray-800 ... -->
    </tr>
</thead>
```

## 🚀 **Result**
- Table header now remains completely solid when scrolling
- Column names (Rank, Team, Incidents, Avg Resolution, FCR Rate, SLA Goal, SLA Baseline, SLA Breaches, Breach Rate, Critical Breaches) stay visible
- Improved user experience when viewing team data like "IDC Pardhanani" and "IDC Building 10"

## 📍 **Location**
- **File**: `templates/dashboard.html`
- **Lines**: ~910-920 (Team Performance section)
- **Function**: Main dashboard team performance table

## ✅ **Status**
**COMPLETED** - Fix has been applied and saved to the template file.
