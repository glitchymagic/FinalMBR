# Final Changes Summary: MTTR and FCR Logic Updates

## Overview
Per leadership's wishes, both MTTR and FCR calculation logic have been updated to match the logic from finalMTTR.py and finalfcr.py respectively. The dashboard integration remains unchanged, but the underlying calculations are now more accurate.

## 1. MTTR Changes

### Key Updates:
- **Business Hours Calculation**: Now excludes ALL weekend hours (not just weekend-created incidents)
- **More Accurate SLA Tracking**: Only counts working hours (Mon-Fri) when calculating resolution time

### Impact:
```
Example: Incident created Friday 4pm, resolved Monday 10am
- Old: 66 hours (includes weekend)
- New: 2 hours (only business hours)
```

### Files Changed:
- **MTTR.py**: Added `calculate_business_minutes()` function
- **app.py**: Updated to use business hours calculation
- **finalMTTR.py**: Deleted (logic integrated)

## 2. FCR Changes

### Key Updates:
- **Invalid Data Handling**: Excludes null/invalid reopen counts from FCR calculation
- **More Accurate Metrics**: Only valid data considered in percentage calculation

### Impact:
```
Example: 100 incidents, 5 with invalid reopen counts, 90 with reopen=0
- Old: FCR = 90/100 = 90.0%
- New: FCR = 90/95 = 94.7%
```

### Files Changed:
- **FCR.py**: Added validation logic and reopen distribution analysis
- **app.py**: Updated to handle invalid reopen counts properly
- **finalfcr.py**: Deleted (logic integrated)

## 3. Dashboard Updates

### Data Loading:
```python
# MTTR: Calculate business hours
incidents_df['MTTR_business_minutes'] = incidents_df.apply(
    lambda row: calculate_business_minutes(row['Created'], row['Resolved']), axis=1
)

# FCR: Keep invalid values for proper handling
incidents_df['Reopen count'] = pd.to_numeric(incidents_df['Reopen count'], errors='coerce')
```

### API Endpoints:
- **MTTR**: No weekday filtering needed (business hours handles it)
- **FCR**: Filters out invalid reopen counts before calculation

### Aggregations:
- **MTTR**: Uses business hours MTTR for all calculations
- **FCR**: Lambda functions updated to handle NaN values

## 4. Expected Changes When Dashboard Restarts

1. **MTTR Metrics**:
   - Lower average MTTR (weekend hours excluded)
   - More accurate SLA compliance percentages
   - Better reflection of actual working time

2. **FCR Metrics**:
   - Slightly higher FCR rates (invalid data excluded)
   - More accurate team performance metrics
   - Data quality warnings in console

## 5. Testing

To verify the changes:
```bash
# Test MTTR logic
python3 MTTR.py

# Test FCR logic  
python3 FCR.py

# Restart dashboard
python3 app.py
```

## 6. Benefits

- **Accuracy**: Both metrics now reflect true business performance
- **Compliance**: Aligns with leadership requirements
- **Data Quality**: Better handling of edge cases and invalid data
- **Insights**: More meaningful metrics for decision-making

## Files Summary
- **Updated**: MTTR.py, FCR.py, app.py
- **Created**: MTTR_CHANGES_SUMMARY.md, FCR_CHANGES_SUMMARY.md
- **Deleted**: finalMTTR.py, finalfcr.py
