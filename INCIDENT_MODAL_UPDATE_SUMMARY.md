# Incident Drill-Down Modal Update Summary

## Changes Made

### Backend Updates (app.py)

1. **Replaced Incident Categories with Top KB Articles**
   - Removed the team-based incident categories section
   - Added analysis of top Knowledge Base articles used
   - Each KB article includes:
     - KB ID (e.g., KB1149657)
     - Descriptive title (e.g., "End of Life (EOL) Laptop Returns & Replacements")
     - Usage count and percentage

2. **Removed Sections**
   - Regional distribution analysis and chart
   - Daily patterns analysis
   - Peak hours analysis and hourly chart

3. **Updated Insights**
   - Added KB coverage percentage
   - Added unique KB articles count
   - Kept average daily incidents and major incident ratio

### Frontend Updates (dashboard.html)

1. **HTML Structure Changes**
   - Changed "Top Incident Categories" to "Top KB Articles Used"
   - Removed Regional Distribution card and chart
   - Removed Daily Patterns and Peak Hours Analysis sections
   - Updated element ID from `incident-categories-list` to `incident-kb-articles-list`

2. **JavaScript Updates**
   - Updated `populateIncidentDrillDown()` function to display KB articles
   - Each KB article shows:
     - KB ID in cyan monospace font
     - Description text below
     - Usage count and percentage on the right
   - Removed all code for regional chart, daily patterns, and hourly chart
   - Updated "Peak Hour" metric to show "KB Coverage" percentage instead

## Visual Changes

### Before
- Top Incident Categories (by team)
- Regional Distribution (pie chart)
- Daily Patterns (list)
- Peak Hours Analysis (bar chart)

### After
- Top KB Articles Used (with descriptions)
- Cleaner, more focused layout
- KB coverage metric in summary cards

## Benefits

1. **More Actionable Data**: Seeing which KB articles are most used helps identify:
   - Common issues that need documentation
   - KB articles that may need updates
   - Training opportunities

2. **Cleaner Interface**: Removing three sections makes the modal less cluttered and easier to navigate

3. **Better Context**: KB article descriptions provide immediate understanding of what issues are being resolved

## Testing
- Click on any month in the Incident Data chart
- Modal should show Top KB Articles Used instead of categories
- No regional, daily, or hourly charts should appear
- KB Coverage percentage should display in summary cards
