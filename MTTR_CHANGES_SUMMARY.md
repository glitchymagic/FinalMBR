# MTTR Calculation Changes Summary

## Overview
Per leadership's wishes, the MTTR calculation has been updated to use **business hours** instead of total elapsed time. This provides more accurate SLA tracking by excluding weekend hours from resolution time calculations.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. **MTTR.py Updated**
- Integrated `calculate_business_minutes()` function from finalMTTR.py
- Now calculates MTTR excluding ALL weekend hours (not just weekend-created incidents)
- Maintains dashboard integration examples and documentation
- Shows comparison between total elapsed time and business hours

### 2. **app.py Dashboard Updates**

#### Data Loading Changes:
```python
# OLD: Total elapsed time with weekday filtering
incidents_df['MTTR_calculated'] = (resolved - created).total_seconds() / 60
avg_mttr = weekday_incidents['MTTR_calculated'].mean()

# NEW: Business hours calculation
from MTTR import calculate_business_minutes
incidents_df['MTTR_business_minutes'] = calculate_business_minutes(created, resolved)
incidents_df['MTTR_calculated'] = incidents_df['MTTR_business_minutes']
avg_mttr = incidents_df['MTTR_calculated'].mean()  # No weekday filter needed
```

#### Removed Weekday Filtering:
- `api_overview()`: Removed `is_weekday_created` filter for MTTR
- `get_monthly_trends()`: Simplified aggregation - no lambda for weekday filtering
- `api_team_performance()`: Simplified team MTTR calculation

### 3. **Impact on Metrics**

#### Example: Incident created Friday 4:00 PM, resolved Monday 10:00 AM

**Old Calculation:**
- Total elapsed: 66 hours (3,960 minutes)
- SLA Met: NO (exceeds 240 minute threshold)

**New Calculation:**
- Business hours: 2 hours (120 minutes)
- SLA Met: YES (under 240 minute threshold)

### 4. **Expected Dashboard Changes**

When the dashboard is restarted with these changes:

1. **Lower MTTR values** - Weekend hours excluded
2. **Higher SLA compliance rates** - More incidents meet SLA
3. **More accurate metrics** - Reflects actual business operating hours
4. **Fairer team performance** - Teams not penalized for weekend time

### 5. **SLA Thresholds (Unchanged)**
- Baseline: 240 minutes (4 hours)
- Goal: 180 minutes (3 hours)

### 6. **Backwards Compatibility**
- `MTTR_total_minutes` field preserved for comparison
- `MTTR_calculated` now uses business hours for all calculations
- Original 'Resolve time' field validated but not used for calculations

## Files Modified
1. **MTTR.py** - Complete rewrite with business hours logic
2. **app.py** - Updated imports and removed weekday filtering
3. **finalMTTR.py** - Deleted (logic integrated into MTTR.py)

## Benefits
- More accurate SLA tracking aligned with business operations
- Fair measurement that doesn't penalize for non-business hours
- Consistent with industry standard practices
- Better reflects actual team performance

## Testing
Run `python MTTR.py` to see:
- Business hours calculation examples
- Comparison with total elapsed time
- Expected impact on real data
