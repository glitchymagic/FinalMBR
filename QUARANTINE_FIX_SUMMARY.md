# Tech Spot FY26 Report - Quarantine Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The user reported receiving a macOS "damaged and can't be opened" error when trying to run the Tech Spot FY26 Report application. This is a common issue with unsigned applications created by PyInstaller on macOS.

## Root Cause
- macOS Gatekeeper quarantines applications downloaded from the internet
- Unsigned applications (those without Apple Developer Certificate) trigger this security warning
- The application is completely functional - the error is purely a security precaution

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Quarantine Fix Script
Created `fix_macos_quarantine.sh` that:
- Removes the `com.apple.quarantine` attribute from the app bundle
- Makes the executable file properly executable
- Provides user-friendly feedback and instructions
- Handles edge cases and error conditions

### 2. Multiple Fix Options
Provided three different solutions:
- **Automatic Script**: One-command fix using the shell script
- **Right-Click Method**: GUI-based solution for non-technical users  
- **Manual Command**: Direct terminal command for advanced users

### 3. Comprehensive Documentation
Created multiple instruction files:
- `QUICK_FIX_README.txt` - Simple, immediate reference
- `QUARANTINE_FIX_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Detailed step-by-step guide
- Updated distribution package with all fix materials

## Files Created/Updated

### New Files:
- `fix_macos_quarantine.sh` - Automated fix script
- `QUICK_FIX_README.txt` - Quick reference guide  
- `QUARANTINE_FIX_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Comprehensive instructions

### Updated Package:
- `Tech_Spot_FY26_Report_macOS_FIXED_20250702_165723.zip` (111MB)
- Contains app + all fix materials + documentation

## Technical Details

### Quarantine Removal Command:
```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine "Tech Spot FY26 Report.app"
```

### Permission Fix:
```bash
chmod +x "Tech Spot FY26 Report.app/Contents/MacOS/Tech Spot FY26 Report"
```

### Verification:
```bash
xattr -l "Tech Spot FY26 Report.app"
```
