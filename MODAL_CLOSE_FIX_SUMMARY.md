# Modal Close Fix Summary

## Issue
When clicking on a data point in the charts, the drill-down modal opens correctly. However, when trying to close the modal, it immediately reopens because the chart click event is still being processed.

## Root Cause
Chart.js click events can sometimes fire multiple times or remain active even after the modal is opened, causing the modal to reopen immediately when closed.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Global Flag
- Created `modalClosing` flag to prevent modals from reopening during close animation
- Flag is set to `true` when any modal close function is called
- Flag is reset to `false` after a 500ms delay

### 2. Updated Chart Click Handlers
- All chart onClick functions now check `!modalClosing` before opening modals
- This prevents modals from reopening while they're in the process of closing

### 3. Added Click-Outside-to-Close
- Added event listeners for all drill-down modals to close when clicking outside
- Clicking on the modal backdrop (dark area) will close the modal

### 4. Added ESC Key Support
- Extended existing ESC key handler to include all drill-down modals
- Pressing ESC will close any open modal

## Files Modified
- `templates/dashboard.html`
  - Added `modalClosing` flag
  - Updated all chart onClick handlers
  - Updated all close functions (closeMTTRDrillDown, closeIncidentDrillDown, closeFCRDrillDown)
  - Added click-outside event listeners
  - Extended ESC key handler

## Testing
1. Click on any chart data point - modal should open
2. Click the X button - modal should close and stay closed
3. Click outside the modal - modal should close
4. Press ESC key - modal should close
5. All close methods should prevent immediate reopening
