# Pre-TSQ Consultation Dashboard Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a new consultation analytics dashboard as a separate page/tab alongside the existing incident tracking dashboard. The consultation dashboard analyzes data from `Pre-TSQ Data (1) (1).csv` and provides line graphs showing consultation completion trends.

## Data Source
- **File**: `Pre-TSQ Data (1) (1).csv`
- **Records**: ~29,798 consultation records (January and July excluded to match incident timeframe)
- **Date Range**: February 2025 - June 2025 (FY26, exactly aligned with incident data)
- **Key Fields**: 
  - ID, Location, Created, Name, Issue
  - Technician Name, Consult Complete (Yes/No)
  - INC # (when consultation escalated to incident)
  - Equipment Type, Consultation Defined, Notes

## Implementation Details

### Backend (app.py)
1. **Data Loading**: Added consultation data loading in `load_data()` function
2. **Global Variables**: Added `consultations_df` alongside `incidents_df`
3. **New API Endpoints**:
   - `/consultations` - Serves the consultation dashboard HTML
   - `/api/consultations/overview` - Overview metrics with quarter filtering
   - `/api/consultations/trends` - Monthly trend data for charts
4. **Quarter Filtering**: Same Q1/Q2 logic as incident dashboard
5. **JSON Serialization**: Fixed pandas int64 conversion for API responses

### Frontend (templates/consultations.html)
1. **Navigation**: Added tabs to switch between Incidents and Consultations
2. **Overview Cards**: 
   - Total Consultations
   - Completed Consultations (with completion rate)
   - INC Created (escalation rate)
   - Active Technicians (with location count)
   - **Missing INC #** (data quality tracking)
3. **Analytics Panels**: Three comprehensive data analysis components
   - **Consultation Volume**: Monthly consultation counts (blue theme line chart)
   - **ðŸ¤– AI Insights**: Intelligent data analysis with actionable recommendations
   - **Issue Breakdown**: Pie chart showing consultation types by frequency (vibrant palette)
4. **Styling**: Fully matched main dashboard styling:
   - Walmart GT Brand Palette (Bogle font, brand colors)
   - Animated elements (floating headers, pulsing numbers, fade-in cards)
   - Theme toggle (light/dark mode with localStorage persistence)
   - Progress bars, hover effects, and refresh indicators
   - Staggered animations and Walmart-compliant transitions

### Navigation Enhancement
- Added navigation tabs to both dashboards:
  - Main dashboard: "Incidents" (active) | "Consultations"
  - Consultation dashboard: "Incidents" | "Consultations" (active)
- Seamless navigation between the two analytics views
